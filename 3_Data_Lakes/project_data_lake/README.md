# UDACITY DATA ENGINEERING NANODEGREE
# PROJECT 4 - Build a Data Lake
---
## Introduction

This repository contains files for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree class project.

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and needs to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, processes them using Spark, and load the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow analytics teams to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Description

Use Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. Load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. Deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS. 

### _Song Dataset_

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### _Log Dataset_

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Project Components

The project in this repository requires two files used to perform ELT and Data Lake formation. Additionally you can find one folder to illustrate testing:

- `etl.py` will load data from an S3 bucket using a Spark distributed dataframe, transform it for our analytical purposes and load it in the parquet format back into S3. 

- `dl.cfg` A Config file with all security credentials to connect to AWS services. This file *must be created* on a local instance. It is not present on git to mask credentionals 

- `trial/trial_etl.ipynb` is a record of trial processes to test individueal components of the ELT process.

### _Installation and Operation_

1. Using AWS, create an Elastic Map Reduce cluster using your prefered tool (console, CLI or SDK). Choose an installation with Hadoop and Spark and preferably a cluster of 4 total machines (1 Driver and 3 Worker nodes)
2. Create an Amazon S3 bucket as the destination store for your final data 
3. Edit the `output_data = ` variable in the etl.py file with the path of the destination s3 bucket.
4. Gather SSH information and connect to the driver node in a terminal window.
5. Use SCP or another method (such as git) to move the files from this repository to the master node and move into that directory.
6. Create a file named `dl.cfg` in the project folder with your your aws credentials in the following format:
```
[AWS]
KEY='<yourkey>'
SECRET='<yoursecret>'
```

7. Finally, run `/usr/bin/spark-submit --master yarn ./etl.py` from the command line

---
### Output

The script will transform and organize data into file folders in the destination S3 bucket. 

# Schema for Song Play Analysis
Saved to S3 are fact and dimensional tables in a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis.

Files are stored in the Apache Parquet format for high performance data IO.

This includes the following tables.

**Fact Table**
1. songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
    - folders are partitioned by `year` and `month`

**Dimension Tables**

2. users - users in the app
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
    - all user files nested under `users` folder
3. songs - songs in music database
    - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
    - partioned by `year` then `artist`
4. artists - artists in music database
    - *artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude*
    - all artists files nested under `artists` folder  
5. time - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
    - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*
    - all timestamp files nested under `time` folder
